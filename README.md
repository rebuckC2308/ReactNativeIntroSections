# ReactNativeIntroSections
This repo is dedicated to the introductory sections of the React Native + Hooks course that I am taking on Udemy.  

I am excited for this course and am looking forward to building applications that can be used on a mobile device.   This first commit will be focused on the first three components that were built in the early sections.  In these sections I learned how to build a component, use a flatList element to render a list on screen, create and use reusable components, as well as navigation between screens.  This has been fun so far and I'm looking forward to the rest of the course.

The next few commits will be focused on State Management in Components.
